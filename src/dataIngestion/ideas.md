RSS parsing
Add a new capabaility for adding a document source, for now we'll just support adding an RSS feed.

This feature will:
* take a URI for a feed (e.g. @https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/tag/ai/feed/). This URI will be stored in our MongoDB database in a documentSources collection.
* accept an "expire after" option that allows for expiring content after X months or X years. Date expiration is based off of the RSS pubDate element or an updated date (based on RSS or ATOM standards)
* Include an command argument for adding document sources
* Add a capability to ingest data sources, which will iterate through all RSS feed sources, and add each document represented in the feed.
